<h2 align="center">Project Overview</h2>
Musicool Show-List is a web app designed for musical lovers all around the world. This app provides a comprehensive and easily accessible database of musicals currently playing globally. For fans of musicals, it’s often difficult to know when and where new musicals are playing. This app solves that problem by letting users contribute to the database, adding new musicals, and updating the list to reflect the latest performances.

Users can also create a personal list of musicals they wish to see, ensuring they never miss an opportunity to enjoy their favorite shows. If a musical stops playing, users can easily remove it from the list. With this app, musical enthusiasts can stay up-to-date on all things musical theater!
